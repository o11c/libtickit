.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_term_goto\fP() moves the terminal output cursor to the absolute position specified. On some terminals, either \fIline\fP or \fIcol\fP may be specified as -1 to move within the line or column it is currently in. Not all terminals may support this; so the return value of \fBtickit_term_goto\fP() should be checked.
.PP
\fBtickit_term_move\fP() moves the terminal output cursor relative to its current position. Either \fIdownward\fP or \fIrightward\fP may be specified as 0 to not move in that direction.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBtickit_term_goto\fP() returns a boolean value indicating whether it was able to support the requested movement. \fBtickit_term_move\fP() returns no value.
