.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_renderbuffer_setpen\fP() changes the attributes of the stored pen in the buffer to those in the given \fBTickitPen\fP() instance, removing any that are not present in \fIpen\fP. The stored pen is used by default by drawing operations, being merged into the pen that is passed to the operation function.
.PP
If there is a stored pen in the previous stack level, then the attributes in that pen will be merged into the current one, before the passed one is applied. In effect, the actual pen used by drawing functions is merged from up to three possible sources of pen; in order of precidence: the pen argument passed to the drawing operation function, the pen argument passed to \fBtickit_renderbuffer_setpen\fP(), and the combined stored pen from the previous stack level (which was itself merged from the pen argument and the stored pen of the stack level below that, and so on).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
This function returns nothing.
